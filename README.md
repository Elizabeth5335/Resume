# Resume
First Resume was a kind of test project to show my bootstrap 5 skills.  

It is a one-page website with adaptive layout. It was written using HTML (bootstrap 5), CSS and some JavaScript for animations.  

The aim of this project was to show my ability to work with bootstrap 5: create responsive tables, long descriptions, images and so on.  

It was hosted on GitHub Pages: https://elizabeth5335.github.io/Resume
