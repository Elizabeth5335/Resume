              <dd>I have been paying the guitar for 7 years. My first guitar I got from my godfather as a gift for birthday. And my last guitar was gifted me this february. Unfortunately, I didn`t manage to try it because of the war.</dd>
            <dt>Playing the piano</dt>
              <dd>I was going to a music school in the childhood, but didn`t finish it. However, I learnt to play the piano.</dd>
            <dt>Writing poems</dt>
              <dd>At the age of 4, I tried to write small poems. Now I have more than 30 ones.</dd>
            <dt>Plants</dt>
              <dd>In Ukraine I had a lot of pots with plants. I loved them. And almost all my room was filled with plants.</dd>
